# Tribute Page

Responsive Web Design Projects - Build a Tribute Page for Free Code Camp.

## Free Code Camp Project Objective: 
Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: (https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNqgVx)
Project must meet the following specifications: 

### User Story #1:   

My tribute page should have an element with a corresponding id="main", which contains all other elements.

### User Story #2:   
I should see an element with a corresponding id="title", which contains a string (i.e. text) that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug").

### User Story #3:   
I should see a div element with a corresponding id="img-div".

### User Story #4: 
Within the img-div element, I should see an img element with a corresponding id="image".

### User Story #5: 
Within the img-div element, I should see an element with a corresponding id="img-caption" that contains textual content describing the image shown in img-div.

### User Story #6: 
I should see an element with a corresponding id="tribute-info", which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.

### User Story #7: 
I should see an a element with a corresponding id="tribute-link", which links to an outside site that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. HINT: You must give your element an attribute of target and set it to _blank in order for your link to open in a new tab (i.e. target="_blank").

### User Story #8: 
The img element should responsively resize, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size.

### User Story #9: 
The img element should be centered within its parent element.
